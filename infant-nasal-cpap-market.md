<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infant Nasal CPAP Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HFNC</li><li>Mechanical</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The infant nasal CPAP market comprises two primary types: High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) and mechanical CPAP systems. HFNC delivers humidified and warmed oxygen at high flows, enhancing comfort and reducing respiratory distress in infants. In contrast, mechanical CPAP provides continuous positive airway pressure through a machine, ensuring stable breathing by preventing airway collapse. Both types are essential in neonatal care, catering to varying degrees of respiratory challenges in premature and critically ill infants.</p></p>
